# Bookstore-Database
School project - A database designed for a bookstore using MySQL.

This application allows users to display, as well as modify, a database. The data is displayed using a JTable, allowing the user to
easily make changes to the underlying database by simply editting (double-clicking and typing new values) cells. Implements a log-in
system to permissions of different users (Functionality to assign an admin user and pass).

Also allows the user to query the database and selectively display specific data.

<b>See the ReadMe-Installation and ReadMe-Application_Usage text files for detailed instructions on installing and using the application.</b>
